            <h6> Kids are spending so much time on their electronics and other wasteful activities. They do not spend enough time
              on meaningful tasks that build character, personable skills, etc. This app tracks the productive tasks that
              kids do in order to earn "bank time" that kids can spend when they want. The parents set the weight for each
              activity, so they can deem what they feel is important.

            <h6>Wouldn't it be great if a kid spent more time doing important and constructive things in life rather than just
              playing with their electronics? Bank time is accumulated when a child does any productive task that a parent
              considers meaningful. The parent will set the weight of their child's productive task, and they will earn bank
              time at that specific rate of the weight (in percentages). For example, if a parent sets the weight of homework
              to 50%, a child will earn 5 minutes of "bank time" for every 10 minutes of "homework time".
